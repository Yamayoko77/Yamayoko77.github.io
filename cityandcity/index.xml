      <description>Do you remember when we were little?
We were playing in the park,
And you asked me what happens when we die.
I said you forget everything&amp;hellip;
Everything.
&amp;ldquo;Even you?&amp;rdquo; you asked.
&amp;ldquo;Yes, even me.&amp;rdquo;
You did not want to die.
Never forget.
The remains of what we used to have,
Were taken away with the softest squeeze.
How did I forget?
How&amp;hellip;?</description>
